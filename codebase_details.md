ðŸ“‚ Detailed Description of Each Directory
1. configs/
Contains configuration files for hyperparameters, paths, model settings, etc.

config.yaml: General configuration file that includes training settings like batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, etc.

model_config.yaml: Configuration specific to the flow-based model (e.g., model architecture details, hidden layers, etc.).

2. data/
Handles dataset loading and preprocessing.

dataset.py: Contains dataset class and logic to load the data (both training and validation datasets).

transforms.py: Defines any transformations or augmentation functions used in preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalizing).

3. logs/
Where PyTorch Lightning logs are stored (used for monitoring training).

lightning_logs/: Directory for storing logs generated by PyTorch Lightningâ€™s built-in logger.

4. models/
Contains model definitions.

base_model.py: Contains the common structure for models, such as forward/backward methods, optimizer setup.

flow_model.py: Defines the specific architecture of your flow-based model, which will likely subclass pl.LightningModule for PyTorch Lightning.

5. training/
Contains all the logic for training and evaluation.

train.py: Main training script that initializes the PyTorch Lightning Trainer and runs the training loop.

trainer.py: Custom training logic such as callbacks for checkpoints, early stopping, etc.

metrics.py: Contains code for any metrics you'd like to track during training or evaluate post-training (e.g., FID, Inception score).

6. inference/
Handles inference logic after the model is trained.

infer.py: Contains code to load the trained model and make predictions on new data.

7. utils/
Helper functions and utilities used across different parts of the project.

logger.py: Includes logging utilities to handle TensorBoard, WandB, or custom logs.

checkpoint.py: Code for saving and loading checkpoints during training.

8. main.py
Main entry point to start the training or inference process. It loads the configuration, sets up data, and starts training or inference depending on the userâ€™s command.

9. Description of Each Testing File
1. tests/test_data.py
Contains unit tests for data loading and preprocessing.

Test dataset loading logic using mock or random datasets.

Verify transformations and augmentations work correctly.

2. tests/test_model.py
Contains unit tests for model architecture and forward pass.

Test the flow model's forward pass with random input.

Ensure model components (e.g., flow layers, loss function) are connected properly.

3. tests/test_train.py
Contains unit tests for the training loop.

Test the model's optimizer and scheduler.

Ensure that the training loop can run a few epochs without issues.

4. tests/test_inference.py
Contains unit tests for inference.

Test that inference functions generate outputs as expected.

Check that model inference works with random inputs.

5. tests/test_logger.py
Contains unit tests for logging with WandB and TensorBoard.

Mock the logging process and ensure logs are correctly recorded.

6. tests/test_metrics.py
Contains unit tests for metrics like FID or other evaluation metrics.

Test the calculation of metrics with random output and reference data.

7. tests/utils/test_checkpoint.py
Contains unit tests for saving and loading model checkpoints.

Verify that the model's state is saved and restored properly.

8. tests/fixtures/mock_data.py
Contains code to generate random datasets for unit tests (e.g., random image tensors, text sequences).
